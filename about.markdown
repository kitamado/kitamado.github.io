## Hi there,

I just started to build my github pages.
You can see my resume [here](https://kitamado.github.io/markdown-cv/). 


### About "kitamado"

きたまど is a Japanese word means "north window". Roughly speaking, you cannot see the moon in a northern side window of the northern hemisphere，that is 月知らず. And "Arrived"(着き) is pronounced as "Moonlight(tsuki)" in Japanese. So，月知らず --> 着き知らず. Just a pun joke.
